# Developer Guide: Integrating Kaia Gas Abstraction (GA)

This guide consolidates best practices and technical details for integrating Kaia's Gas Abstraction (GA) feature. It draws from comprehensive overviews, deep protocol dives, practical tutorials, and real-world examples to help you build seamless, gas-free experiences. By the end, you'll be able to enable users to pay fees with ERC-20 tokens, reducing onboarding friction and boosting retention.
