## Developer Perspective

| Feature | Ethereum | Kaia |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

## What Stays the Same

* **High EVM compatibility:** Kaia's strong EVM compatibility means most Ethereum dApps, tools (Hardhat, Foundry, Remix), and Solidity contracts can be migrated or used with minimal changes. This is the biggest "stays the same" aspect.  
* **Familiar Development Tools & Languages:** Solidity remains the primary smart contract language. Ethereum development tools like Remix, Hardhat, and Foundry are largely usable.  
* **Standard Ethereum Wallet Compatibility:** Standard Ethereum wallets like MetaMask can be used by changing the RPC URL and ChainID.  
* **`eth_` RPC Namespace:** The `eth_` namespace for RPC APIs allows interaction similar to Ethereum for common functionalities, ensuring compatibility with existing Ethereum tools for standard operations.  
* **Standard Ethereum Address Format:** Kaia uses the standard Ethereum address format (`0x` \+ 40 hex chars).

## Whatâ€™s Different

* **Performance & Cost:**  
  * Expect significantly higher Transactions Per Second (TPS) (up to 4,000 TPS) compared to Ethereum's \~15-30 TPS.  
  * Block times are much faster at 1-second.  
  * Kaia offers immediate finality, a significant difference from Ethereum's probabilistic finality.  
  * Transaction fees (gas) are designed to be low and stable, using an EIP-1559 compatible fee model. Gas price will be in `kei`.  
* **RPC & SDKs:**  
  * While `eth_` namespace is supported, the `kaia_` namespace is necessary for new or Kaia-specific features and transaction types.  
  * Legacy `klay_` namespace might exist and is equivalent to the `kaia_` namespace.  
  * Kaia provides its own SDK extensions for popular Web3 libraries ([Ethers-ext](https://docs.kaia.io/references/sdk/ethers-ext/getting-started/), [Web3js-ext](https://docs.kaia.io/references/sdk/web3js-ext/getting-started/), [Web3j-ext](https://docs.kaia.io/references/sdk/web3j-ext/getting-started/), [Web3py-ext](https://docs.kaia.io/references/sdk/web3py-ext/getting-started/), and [Viem-ext](https://docs.kaia.io/references/sdk/viem-ext/getting-started/)) that enable seamless migration from Ethereum while providing access to Kaia's enhanced features and performance benefits.  
* **Native Features (Beyond Standard EVM):**  
  * **Account Abstraction:** Kaia has advanced account features (for example, multiple keys per account, role-based permissions), offering more flexibility than Ethereum's EOA model.  
  * **Transaction Types:** Kaia will have its own native transaction types alongside Ethereum's (for example, for account updates, fee delegation). For Ethereum transactions, use standard `eth_` RPCs for best compatibility.  
  * **Fee Delegation:** This feature can significantly improve UX by allowing dApps to pay gas fees for users.  
* **Consensus & Governance:**  
  * The consensus mechanism is an optimized version of Istanbul BFT (IBFT), different from Ethereum's Gasper, leading to faster block times and immediate finality.  
  * Governance involves an on-chain Governance Council (GC), differing from Ethereum's more fluid off-chain governance.  
* **Token:** The native token is KAIA. Tokenomics and utility is specific to Kaia.  
* **Node Architecture:** Kaia uses a **purpose-built, layered architecture** with [specialized node types](https://docs.kaia.io/learn/#network-architecture) (Core Cells for consensus, Endpoint Nodes for public access) designed to optimize performance and security, differing from Ethereum's unified client approach.  
* **Mempool:** Transaction handling and public mempool visibility might differ due to Kaia's specific network architecture, with less emphasis on a global, public mempool like Ethereum's.  
* **Precompiled Contracts:** While base EVM precompiles are supported, Kaia may feature additional Kaia-specific precompiled contracts.

## Next Steps for Builders

1. **Configure Your Environment**  
Configure your existing Ethereum tools to work with Kaia:

* [Mainnet RPC](https://docs.kaia.io/references/public-en/#mainnet-public-json-rpc-endpoints): https://public-en.node.kaia.io ([Chain ID](https://docs.kaia.io/nodes/service-chain/configure/configuration-files/#properties-): 8217\)  
* Testnet: Kairos testnet for testing ([get free tokens](https://docs.kaia.io/build/get-started/getting-kaia/) from [faucet](https://www.kaia.io/faucet))  
* Tools: Hardhat, Foundry, and MetaMask work without modification

2. **Deploy and Test**  
Your Solidity contracts deploy unchanged due to full EVM compatibility. Test on Kairos testnet to verify gas usage patterns under Kaia's dynamic fee model.

3. **Leverage Kaia's Advantages**

* Immediate Finality: 1-second blocks with instant finality eliminate confirmation waiting  
* [Lower Gas Costs](https://docs.kaia.io/learn/transaction-fees/#effective-gas-price-): Build features that would be too expensive on Ethereum  
* [Fee Delegation](https://docs.kaia.io/build/transactions/fee-delegation/): Let your dApp pay user transaction fees to improve UX  
* [Gas Abstraction](https://github.com/kaiachain/kaia/releases/tag/v2.0.0): Users can pay fees with approved tokens (not just KAIA)

4. **Use Appropriate APIs and SDKs**

* Standard `eth_` namespace for Ethereum-compatible operations  
* `kaia_` namespace for accessing Kaia-specific features and transaction types  
* While ethers.js and web3.js work perfectly, consider exploring [Kaia's SDKs](https://docs.kaia.io/references/sdk/) for easier integration with native features.

5. **Stay Informed** 

* Consult the [Kaia Docs](https://docs.kaia.io/) that are your primary source for the latest information.  
* Engage with other builders and the Kaia team on the [Kaia Developer Forum](https://devforum.kaia.io/) and other community channels for support and updates.
