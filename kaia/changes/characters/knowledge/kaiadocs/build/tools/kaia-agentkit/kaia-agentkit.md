# Introduction

Kaia Agent Kit is a powerful toolkit designed to help developers build AI agents that interact with the Kaia blockchain autonomously and securely. With the Agent Kit, AI agents can access wallets, perform onchain actions, and execute blockchain interactions without manual input.

By using Kaia Agent Kit, developers can build an ecosystem of AI agents capable of:

- Monitoring and executing trades based on market signals
- Deploying and managing smart contracts autonomously
- Handling complex DeFi operations with intelligence and precision
- And much more

Kaia Agent Kit is designed with framework flexibility in mind. It supports any AI tooling or framework, including LangChain, Eliza, Vercel AI SDK, and others. Whether you are working with a custom LLM stack or an existing AI workflow, you can extend it with Kaiaâ€™s onchain capabilities.
