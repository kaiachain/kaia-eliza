# Gaming SDKs

Gaming SDKs in Web3 help solve the challenge of bridging games with the onchain ecosystem. They provide the infrastructure developers need to integrate blockchain features directly into their games.

By using these SDKs, game developers can add the following capabilities to their gaming applications:

- Web3 wallet support for in-game transactions.
- NFT features such as minting, renting, and trading.
- Launching and distributing in-game currency tokens.
- Mobile optimization for Web3 game elements.

The following gaming SDKs have integrated with Kaia to make blockchain gaming possible:

- [Chainsafe Gaming](chainsafe.md)
- [Reown AppKit](reown.md)
