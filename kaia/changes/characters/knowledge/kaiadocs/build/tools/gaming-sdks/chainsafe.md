## Introduction

[ChainSafe Gaming](https://docs.gaming.chainsafe.io/) is a comprehensive toolkit of Web3 gaming products and services designed for studios, developers, and players. It includes the Web3.unity SDK, an NFT minter, marketplaces, and lootboxes.

With the Web3.unity SDK, developers can build blockchain-enabled games with ease. The SDK is compatible with most EVM-based chains such as Ethereum, Kaia, and Binance Smart Chain. This flexibility allows developers to switch networks easily and create the best possible in-game experiences.
