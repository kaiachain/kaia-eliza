# Token Vesting

## Introduction

Token vesting is a mechanism that enables founders to automate token distribution to team members, advisors, investors, and venture capitalists (VCs). By setting predefined vesting schedules, recipients gradually gain access to their allocated tokens over time, ensuring long-term alignment and commitment.

By utilizing Team Finance’s token vesting service, projects can implement secure, transparent, and automated token distributions. Features like customizable vesting schedules, cliffs, and automated releases help prevent premature sell-offs, protecting the token’s value while building trust among stakeholders.
