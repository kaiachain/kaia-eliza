# Liquidity Locks

## Introduction

In crypto, trust and transparency between liquidity providers and investors are essential. Liquidity locks ensure that funds in a liquidity pool remain secure, preventing rug pulls and giving investors confidence that they can trade without unexpected risks. 

Team Financeâ€™s Liquidity Lock feature ensures that liquidity provider (LP) tokens remain securely locked in a liquidity pool for a set duration. This is achieved by transferring the LP tokens to a time-locked smart contract. 

With liquidity locking, token holders can:

* define specific timeframes for unlocking their funds, 
* create multiple locks with different owner addresses and expiration dates, or 
* transfer lock ownership to another wallet. 

:::note
During the lock period, token holders are restricted from accessing their locked tokens.

When the lock period ends, token holders can reclaim their LP tokens through the '[Claims](https://www.team.finance/claim)' dashboard. These tokens can then be exchanged for the paired tokens in the liquidity pool on decentralized exchanges (DEX) like DragonSwap (e.g., WKLAY/USDT).
