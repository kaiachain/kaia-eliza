# Get Started with Kaia

Welcome to Kaia! Whether you're new to blockchain development or experienced with EVM chains, this guide helps you build on Kaia quickly. We'll walk you through setup, tools, and your first projects step by step.

Follow this goal-based path to go from zero to deploying your first smart contract or dApp. Each step builds on the last, so start at the beginning or jump to what you need.

<GetStartedCards />

<h2 id="step-1-foundation-setup">Step 1: Foundation Setup</h2>

Discover Kaia's EVM-compatible architecture, main networks with RPC endpoints and explorers, and key tools like Solidity, SDKs, Hardhat, Foundry, Thirdweb, and Remix for efficient development.

[Foundation Setup](../get-started/foundation-setup.md)

<h2 id="step-2-set-up-wallet--network">Step 2: Set Up Wallet & Network</h2>

Choose a wallet like Kaia Wallet or MetaMask, add the Kaia networks, and create an account.

[How to Configure Your Wallet for Kaia Networks](../wallets/wallet-config/configure-wallet-for-kaia-networks.mdx)

<h2 id="step-3-get-test-kaia">Step 3: Get Test KAIA</h2>

Fund your wallet with testnet KAIA from the faucet to cover gas fees during development.

[Get KAIA](../get-started/getting-kaia.md)

<h2 id="step-4-hello-world-with-remix">Step 4: Hello World with Remix</h2>

Deploy a simple "Hello World" contract using Remix IDE. We'll use the KaiaGreeter sample as your first contract.

[KaiaGreeter](../get-started/kaiagreeter.mdx)

<h2 id="step-5-create-your-first-token">Step 5: Create Your First Token</h2>

Build and deploy a soulbound token (non-transferable NFT) using Hardhat. This covers project setup, testing, and deployment.

[Deploy Your First Smart Contract Using Hardhat](../get-started/hardhat.md)

<h2 id="step-6-build-your-first-dapp-on-kaia">Step 6: Build Your First dApp on Kaia</h2>

Create a full-stack dApp using Scaffold-ETH 2 on Kaia. This tutorial guides you through setting up the development environment, configuring Hardhat for Kaia, deploying and verifying smart contracts, and building a React frontend with Next.js for seamless integration.

<h2 id="step-7-build-a-mini-dapp">Step 7: Build a Mini dApp</h2>

Integrate Web3 features into platforms like LINE using Unity or Cocos. Great for reaching non-crypto users.
