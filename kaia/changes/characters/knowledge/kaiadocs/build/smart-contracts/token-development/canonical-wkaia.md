# Canonical WKAIA

To better streamline the user experience and reduce friction when moving (wrapping and unwrapping) KAIA between dApps, we provide Canonical WKAIA (formerly WKLAY), a standard interface to use Wrapped KAIA in dApps.

In the interest of dApp standardisation and safer smart contracts, we would like our partners to join us in using the canonical implementation of WKAIA, allowing end users to convert KAIA to WKAIA once and use the same WKAIA across dApps.

## Specifics of Implementation

The proposed canonical WKAIA contract is based on WETH standard. We have chosen to follow this standard because it is audited and widely used by popular dApps.

## Deployed Contract Addresses

- Mainnet — 0x19Aac5f612f524B754CA7e7c41cbFa2E981A4432
- Testnet (Kairos) — 0x043c471bEe060e00A56CcD02c0Ca286808a5A436
