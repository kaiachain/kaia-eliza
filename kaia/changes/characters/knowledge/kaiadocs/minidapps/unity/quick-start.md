# Quick Start

## Prerequisites

Before we dive in, make sure you have:

- [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) installed on your computer - this is where we'll build our dApp interface
- Basic C# and JavaScript knowledge - nothing too fancy, just the fundamentals
- A LINE Developer account - you can easily create one using your email
- Test Kaia from [Kaia Faucet](https://faucet.kaia.io/)
- Mini Dapp SDK Client ID receiveed from Dapp Portal team.
- Some familiarity with Web3 concepts - if you understand wallets and tokens, you're good to go.

## Setting Up Your Unity Environment

Let's set up your development environment. We'll start with the Unity setup.

### Step 1: Install and Verify Unity Version

To begin, let's make sure we're all using the same Unity version to avoid any compatibility issues:

- Install Unity Hub if you haven't already.
- Install Unity Editor version 2022.3.50f1 specifically.

### Step 2: Create Your New Unity Project

1. Open Unity Hub and head to the Projects tab.
2. Click the inviting "New project" button in the top-right corner.
3. Under "All templates", select the **3D (Built-in Render Pipeline)** template.
4. Give your project a meaningful name (e.g., mini-dApp-example).
5. Choose a convenient location for your project files.
6. Click **Create project**.
